## 📌 About

This project is a portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It was created as part of my learning journey in web development.

The goal was to build a multi-page showcase site using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some features were added, such as:
- 🎨 A different design for each page  
- ✨ Hover effects and CSS, JS animations  
- 📬 A contact form (still in progress)

---

**🎯 Personal & Learning Goals**

- Practice the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Learn how to organize a clean and structured project  
- Understand how linked files work (scripts, styles, images)  
- Practice building a responsive layout  
- Get used to documenting a project using a `README.md` file
